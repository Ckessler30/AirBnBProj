# BearBNB

## BearBNB Overview
BearBNB is a full stack AirBNB clone that specifically focuses on adventure/outdoors style lodging.  Logged in users can browse several hand picked locations with an abundance of outdoorsy style spots that are available for booking.  Logged in users can also choose to list their very own spot for others to enjoy just as easily. 

## BearBNB Architecture 
BearBNB is build with a React/Redux frontend and a Python/Flask backend that is working PostgreSQL as a database.  The querying is done on the backend using SQLAlchemy.

## Frontend Technologies
### React
BearBNB is a React application that utilizes a good bit of front end logic to display dynamic features.

### Redux
BearBNB is quite dependent on Redux state so that the correct information can be utilized at the correct moments.  Redux thunks are constantly making calls to the backend API to retrieve data.
